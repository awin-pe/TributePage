                        <p>Widely regarded as the "Father of Computer Science", Alan Turing was a mathmatician and codebreaker who was heavily involved in the development of the first electronic computers.</p>
                        <p>During the Second World War, Turing was part of the British code-breaking efforts at Bletchley Park, whose work involved decrypting the German Enigma Code.</p>
                        <p>After the war Turing continued his work in Computing and helped develop the subject.  Sadly, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality and sentenced to chemical treatments.  He died soon after.  </p>
